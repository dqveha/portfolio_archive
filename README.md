## Description

This is a portfolio landing page for the projects that I want to highlight thus far, and an about me section with my personal background. This website is designed to be viewed on resolutions 1200 x 600 and higher.

## Setup/Installation Requirements:

### Installation requirements

    * Computer with browser
    * Internet

### Setup

    1. Download or clone the repository onto your desktop.
    2. Open the .zip file then enter the new folder called "portfolio."
    3. Open index.html using a browser such as Mozilla or Chrome.

## Known Bugs

1. Viewing [the portfolio](https://dqveha.github.io/portfolio/) on a phone device such as an iPhone with Safari browser will not appear correctly. The jumbotron feature is not centered appropriately and its background color stretches outside of the browser to the right.
2. The content appears to be centered until zoomed out on a phone device. If zoomed out, the contents lean more left.
3. Browsers such as Mozilla and Chrome will show the jumbotron lean more to the right when browser width shrinks.
